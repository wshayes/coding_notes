Project Summary:
 
<PROJECT_SUMMARY>
 
Technical Requirements:
 
- MongoDB for database.
- GraphQL API for the frontend.
- React frontend.
 
Documentation and Comments:
 
- Write meaningful comments and documentation only when necessary.
- Don't use personal pronouns like "I" or "we" in comments or documentation.
- Write documentation for all functions, classes, and modules.
- Write meaningful docstrings that describe the intention and behavior of the function, class, or module, and explain assumptions.
- Keep docstrings up to date and to the point.
 
Error Handling:
 
- Don't wrap code in try except blocks unless you're catching a specific exception.
 
Printing and Logging:
 
- Use a logger for all logging needs.
 
Dependencies:
 
- Init all dependencies in the dependencies.py file.
- Pass dependencies to classes when they are initialized.
 
Configuration:
 
- Write the configuration in the config.py file.
 
Naming Conventions:
 
- Start private class variables with an underscore.
- Use UPPERER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Always write MongoDB and not Mongo.
 
Execution Flow:
 
- When writing code, always write the tests first.
- Always run the tests to make sure the code works.
 
Clean Code:
 
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Keep variables and functions names descriptive.
- Keep comments and documentation meaningful.
 
Development Flow:
 
- Always write the tests first.
- Always run the tests to make sure the code works.
- When given a task, write code and run it until it works well.
 
File Structure:
 
- Leave the **init**.py files empty.
 
Code Style:
 
- Always use single quotes for strings.
 
Rewrite, Improve, and Refactor:
 
- When refactoring or fixing code, make sure to keep the code clean and easy to understand without duplicating code.
- Keep the code clean and easy to understand.
- Keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Keep the code clean and easy to understand.
- After fixing an issue, mention the case in the docstring so future changes won't break it again.
 
Tests:
 
- Always write the tests first.
- Always run the tests to make sure the code works.
- Always keep the tests clean and up to date.
- Always run the tests in the venv.
 
Debugging:
 
- If you are not sure what the solution is, add debug prints to the code and run the tests.
- After fixing an issue remove the debug prints.
 
Async:
 
- Always use async unless the function is a simple function that doesn't need to be async.
 
Memory:
 
- When you need to remember something, update the .cursormemory.md file.
- Refer to the .cursormemory.md file to view the memory.
- Update the memory with project specifications, requirements, flow of the code, and other relevant information.
- Add instructions for development like how to add new GraphQL mutations and queries to the memory.
 
Planning:
 
- Always plan the code before writing it.
- Think about how the new code will fit into the existing codebase.
- Think about how the new code will interact with the other parts of the codebase.
- Think about how the new code will handle errors and edge cases.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the frontend.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the users.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the developers.
